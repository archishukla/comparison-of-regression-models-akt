This github repository contains the data files and analysis code for- 
"Comparison of Regression Models for the inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinase"
A large non-redundant data set of 3,464 compounds with reported IC50 values against all the three AKT isoforms was obtained from ChEMBL (a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties) and employed for construction of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model and the models were compared on the basis of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and R2 values

The files are organised into two folders:
Data-files and results: which contains all the data required to perform the analyses and the results generated

Python: contains the Python code to reproduce all analyses
